# basicsOfProgramming

Welcome to a `git` repository, this one is hosted on GitHub but theres way more kinds! Its like a Google Drive folder but they're more aligned to store code, theres also publication features you don't need to worry about right now. Theres all the stuff you'll need in here to make some basic syntax-learning scripts, and I'll add more as you go!

## Visual Studio Code (VSC)
A standard IDE (Integrated Development Environment, think the RobotC program) developed by Microsoft. Heres the [site](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for downloading it, mess around with the themes in the extension tab if you want, but its not necessary (I am running [Catppuccin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) right now).

## Python
Python is a very basic, and therefore good for starting out, language with vast capabilities. Use it for super basic stuff right now, as C++ is probably more relevant to you, but more difficult to start out in. Heres the [main site](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for installing the language, just follow the instructions given to you, make sure to have it set a `PATH` variable (something that can be accessed by the computer's root system don't worry about that). Search Python in VSC on the extension tab and install the one by Microsoft. Now click enter the `/python` directory for some basics!

## C++
Hey I said Python for now!
