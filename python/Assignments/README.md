### Part A
Open up a new Python file and get it to say "Hello World!", this is the first thing everyone does in any language, and it was the first thing anyone used a computer to say (don't fact check that cause I just made it up).

### Part B
Another Python file, this time you're going to make two variables, `a` and `b`. Set these to be integers or floats, and use one of each basic math symbol (`+,-,*,/`) on them, printing the result `f` each time.

### Part C
One last one I swear! This time take a user input and multiply it by a second input! Make sure you use a float point to allow extra user-freedom.
